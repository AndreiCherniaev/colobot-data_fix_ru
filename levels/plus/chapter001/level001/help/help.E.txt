\b;From the NASA Training Center
We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected for the space exploration mission Colobot.

Your psychological profile has been established as more than 98.84% favorable, and your aptitude during the extensive testing period was undeniable. The detailed results are at your disposal in the central computer under the registration number that was assigned to you.

Please report to the \l;Houston Mission Control\u object\Huston; for further directives about your forthcoming mission.

\b;From Houston Mission Control
As you know, Earth is heading towards imminent disaster, due to increasing atmospheric pollution.

\l;Your\u object\human; mission consists of exploring neighboring galaxies with the hopes of finding a planet that will be suitable to human needs and possibly serve as a shelter for mankind. You will be on your own for the entire mission but your spaceship will be carrying a few bots along.

Seven months ago an expedition composed entirely of robots was sent across the cosmos with the same objective. It encountered a fair share of obstacles along the way, apparently landing on planets that were unsuitable for colonization, even possibly outright hostile. Very recently all communications were terminated.

The reasons for the mission's failure are unclear at this date, mainly because of recurrent transmission problems. It is our hope that you will be able to use some of the data it gathered to your advantage.

The last drill left for you to perform before embarking on your journey is to equip your spaceship with its \l;black box\u object\bbox;. A bot tasked with bringing it to the spaceship awaits your signal. You need to build an \l;information exchange post\u object\exchange; near a blue \l;flag\u object\flag; and \l;send\u cbot\send; an information, a \l;tracked builder\u object\botbc; may prove useful for this task.

Unfortunately your \l;bot factory\u object\factory; hasn't yet got the capacity to assemble this type of bot. You need to request your \l;research center\u object\research; to come up with a blueprint for this particular apparatus.

\b;Procedure
1) Perform the necessary \l;research programs\u cbot\researches;.
2) Drop a \l;titanium cube\u object\titan; in the center of the \l;bot factory\u object\factory; and build a \l;tracked builder\u object\botbc;.
3) Reach the top of the southwest-oriented mountain and build an \l;exchange post\u object\exchange; near a blue \l;flag\u object\flag;.
4) \l;Send\u cbot\send; an \l;empty information\u cbot\string; to instruct the carrier to bring the black box back aboard your spaceship.
5) Don't forget to take your \l;grabber\u object\botgr; and \l;builder\u object\botbc; along.
6) Climb aboard the \l;spaceship\u object\base; and take off \button 28;.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.
